- Old degraded photos with some black spots, some strokes etc on it. Erase them in a paint tool because it is will simply replace black structures with white structures which is of no use. In these cases, a technique called image inpainting is used. The basic idea is simple: Replace those bad marks with its neighbouring pixels so that it looks like the neighbourhood.(inpainting.ipynb)
- With Haar Cascading approach, detection of face, eye and smile detection (Haar Cascades.ipynb)
- Corner detection using Harris Corner detection (Corner detection.ipynb)
- Improved Corner Detection using - Good Features to Track (Corner detection.ipynb)
