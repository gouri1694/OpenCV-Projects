- Old degraded photos with some black spots, some strokes etc on it. Erase them in a paint tool because it is will simply replace black structures with white structures which is of no use. In these cases, a technique called image inpainting is used. The basic idea is simple: Replace those bad marks with its neighbouring pixels so that it looks like the neighbourhood.(inpainting.ipynb)

- With Haar Cascading approach, detection of face, eye and smile detection (Haar Cascades.ipynb)

- Corner detection using Harris Corner detection (Corner detection.ipynb)

- Improved Corner Detection using - Good Features to Track (Corner detection.ipynb)

- Advanced Corner Detection using - SIFT,FAST,BRIEF,ORB (Advanced corner detectors.ipynb)

- Feature Matching and Detection. With feature detectors like SIFT,FAST and ORB get the Keypoints in the image, later match the keypoints between both the images using BruteForce matcher technique. Descriptors is used for matching the keypoints, descriptors are the array of values of the detected features (Feature Detection and matching.ipynb)
